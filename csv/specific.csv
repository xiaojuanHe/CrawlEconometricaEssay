March 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA17041,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA17041,Contract Enforcement and Productive Efficiency: Evidence From the Bidding and Renegotiation of Power Contracts in India,"Weak contract enforcement may reduce the efficiency of production in developing countries. I study how contract enforcement affects efficiency in procurement auctions for the largest power projects in India. I gather data on bidding and ex post contract renegotiation and find that the renegotiation of contracts in response to cost shocks is widespread, despite that bidders are allowed to index their bids to future costs like the price of coal. To study heterogeneity in bidding strategies, I construct a new measure of firm connectedness, based on whether a firm has been awarded coal concessions by the Government. Connected firms choose to index less of the value of their bids to coal prices and, through this strategy, expose themselves to cost shocks to induce renegotiation. I use a structural model of bidding in a scoring auction to characterize equilibrium bidding when bidders are heterogeneous both in cost and in the payments they expect after renegotiation. The model estimates show that bidders offer power below cost due to the expected value of later renegotiation. The model is used to simulate bidding and efficiency with strict contract enforcement. Contract enforcement is found to be pro‐competitive. With no renegotiation, equilibrium bids would rise to cover cost, but markups relative to total contract value fall sharply. Production costs decline, due to projects being allocated to lower‐cost bidders over those who expect larger payments in renegotiation.",合同执行不力可能会降低发展中国家的生产效率。我研究了合同的执行方式如何影响印度最大的电力项目的采购拍卖效率。我收集了有关投标和事后合同重新谈判的数据，发现为应对成本冲击而进行的合同重新谈判非常普遍，尽管允许投标人将投标的标价标为将来的成本，例如煤炭价格。为了研究投标策略的异质性，我根据企业是否已获得政府授予的煤炭特许权，构建了一种新的企业联系度度量。关联企业选择对煤炭价格的投标价值指数更少，并通过这种策略使自己承受成本冲击，从而引发重新谈判。当竞标人在成本和重新谈判后期望的付款方式不同时，我会在评分拍卖中使用结构化的竞标模型来描述均衡竞标的特征。模型估计显示，由于后期重新协商的预期价值，投标人提供的费用低于成本。该模型用于通过严格的合同执行来模拟出价和效率。合同执行被认为具有竞争优势。如果不进行重新谈判，平衡竞标价格将上升以弥补成本，但相对于合同总价值的加价幅度却急剧下降。生产成本下降，这是因为将项目分配给了成本较低的竞标者，而不是那些希望通过重新谈判获得更大收益的竞标者。

Suppose the auctioneer can deviate from the rules provided that no single bidder detects the deviation. A mechanism is credible if it is incentive‐compatible for the auctioneer to follow the rules. We study the optimal auctions in which only winners pay, under symmetric independent private values. The first‐price auction is the unique credible static mechanism. The ascending auction is the unique credible strategy‐proof mechanism.",考虑一个广泛的机制，由拍卖人运行，拍卖人与投标人进行顺序和私下交流。假设只要没有一个竞标者能检测到偏差，拍卖师就可以偏离规则。如果一种机制可以激励拍卖人遵循规则，那么它就是可信的。我们研究了对称的独立私人价值下仅由获胜者支付的最优拍卖。第一价格拍卖是独特的可信静态机制。上升拍卖是独特的可信策略证明机制。

We derive in closed form the effects of reforming nonlinearly an arbitrary tax system, by showing that this problem can be formalized as an integral equation. Our tax incidence formulas are valid both when the underlying assignment of skills to tasks is fixed or endogenous. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that contrary to conventional wisdom, if the tax system is initially suboptimal and progressive, the general‐equilibrium “trickle‐down” forces may raise the benefits of increasing the marginal tax rates on high incomes. We finally derive a parsimonious characterization of optimal taxes.",我们研究了具有内生工资连续性的经济体中非线性劳动所得税的发生率。通过证明可以将此问题形式化为一个积分方程，我们以封闭形式得出了非线性改革任意税制的效果。当任务的基本技能分配是固定的或内生的时，我们的税收发生公式均有效。我们从定性和数量上证明，与传统观点相反，如果税收制度最初是次优的和累进的，那么一般均衡的“ tri滴”力量可能会带来提高高收入者边际税率的好处。我们最终得出最优税收的简约特征。
March 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA13426,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA13426,Perfect Conditional ε‐Equilibria of Multi‐Stage Games With Infinite Sets of Signals and Actions,"We extend Kreps and Wilson's concept of sequential equilibrium to games with infinite sets of signals and actions. A strategy profile is a conditional ε‐equilibrium if, for any of a player's positive probability signal events, his conditional expected utility is within ε of the best that he can achieve by deviating. With topologies on action sets, a conditional ε‐equilibrium is full if strategies give every open set of actions positive probability. Such full conditional ε‐equilibria need not be subgame perfect, so we consider a non‐topological approach. Perfect conditional ε‐equilibria are defined by testing conditional ε‐rationality along nets of small perturbations of the players' strategies and of nature's probability function that, for any action and for almost any state, make this action and state eventually (in the net) always have positive probability. Every perfect conditional ε‐equilibrium is a subgame perfect ε‐equilibrium, and, in finite games, limits of perfect conditional ε‐equilibria as ε → 0 are sequential equilibrium strategy profiles. But limit strategies need not exist in infinite games so we consider instead the limit distributions over outcomes. We call such outcome distributions perfect conditional equilibrium distributions and establish their existence for a large class of regular projective games. Nature's perturbations can produce equilibria that seem unintuitive and so we augment the game with a net of permissible perturbations.",我们将Kreps和Wilson的顺序均衡概念扩展到具有无限信号和动作集的游戏。如果对于任何一个玩家的正概率信号事件，他的条件期望效用在他可以通过偏离而达到的最佳状态的ε范围内，则策略配置文件就是条件ε平衡。对于动作集的拓扑，如果策略为每个开放动作集提供正概率，则条件ε平衡将满。这样的完全条件ε均衡不一定是子博弈完美的，因此我们考虑采用非拓扑方法。理想条件ε均衡是通过沿着玩家策略和自然概率函数的小扰动网络测试条件ε合理性而确定的，对于任何行为和几乎任何状态，该行为最终都会（在网络中）总是有正的概率。每个理想条件ε平衡都是子博弈理想ε平衡，在有限博弈中，理想条件ε平衡的极限为ε→0是顺序均衡策略配置文件。但是，无限游戏中不必存在限注策略，因此我们可以考虑限注分布在结果上。我们称这样的结果分布为理想的条件均衡分布，并为一类规则射影博弈建立它们的存在。大自然的扰动会产生似乎不直观的平衡，因此我们通过允许的扰动来扩展游戏。

We use a novel georeferenced data set for the entire African continent between 1998 and 2012 on the coverage of mobile phone signal together with georeferenced data from multiple sources on the occurrence of protests and on individual participation in protests to bring this argument to empirical scrutiny. We find that while mobile phones are instrumental to mass mobilization, this only happens during economic downturns, when reasons for grievance emerge and the cost of participation falls. The results are in line with insights from a network model with imperfect information and strategic complementarities in protest occurrence. Mobile phones make individuals more responsive to both changes in economic conditions—a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced information—and to their neighbors' participation—a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced coordination.",数字信息和通信技术可以促进大规模的政治动员吗？我们在1998年至2012年之间使用了整个非洲大陆的新颖地理参考数据集，涵盖了手机信号的覆盖范围以及来自多个来源的关于抗议事件发生和个人参与抗议活动的地理参考数据，从而将这一论点进行了实证审查。我们发现，尽管移动电话有助于大规模动员，但这仅发生在经济不景气期间，这时人们会感到不满，而参与成本却下降了。结果与来自网络模型的见解相符，该模型具有不完善的信息和抗议活动中的战略互补性。移动电话使个人对经济状况的变化（我们将其归因于增强的信息的一种机制）以及对邻居的参与（对我们的归因于增强的协调性）的响应都更加灵敏。

Much of the literature focuses on the speed of diffusion as a function of the network topology. In practice, the topology may not be known with any precision, and it is constantly in flux as links are formed and severed. Here, we establish an upper bound on the expected waiting time until a given proportion of the population has adopted that holds independently of the network structure. Kreindler and Young (2014) demonstrated such a bound for regular networks when agents choose between two options: the innovation and the status quo. Our bound holds for directed and undirected networks of arbitrary size and degree distribution, and for multiple competing innovations with different payoffs.",新的做事方法通常是通过一些创新者的行动开始的，然后随着越来越多的人与他们的社交网络中的先行者接触而迅速传播。许多文献集中于作为网络拓扑的函数的扩散速度。在实践中，可能无法精确地了解拓扑，并且随着链接的形成和切断，拓扑总是在不断变化。在这里，我们确定了预期等待时间的上限，直到采用给定比例的人口，而该人口与网络结构无关。 Kreindler and Young（2014）在代理商选择两个选项（创新和现状）之间时，证明了对常规网络的这种约束。我们的界限适用于任意大小和程度分布的有向和无向网络，以及具有不同收益的多个竞争性创新。

Steady state equilibrium requires, in particular, that the flows of agents into and out of the population of unmatched agents balance. We investigate the structure of this balance condition, taking agents' matching behavior as given. Building on the “fundamental matching lemma” for quadratic search technologies in Shimer and Smith (2000), we establish existence, uniqueness, and comparative statics properties of the solution to the balance condition for any search technology satisfying minimal regularity conditions. Implications for the existence and structure of steady state equilibria in the Shimer–Smith model and extensions thereof are noted. These reinforce the point that much of the structure of search‐and‐matching models with quadratic search technologies carries over to more general search technologies.",研究带有异质代理和随机搜索的摩擦搜索和匹配模型的大多数文献都研究稳态平衡。稳态平衡​​尤其要求平衡进出无匹配的代理种群的代理流。我们根据给定的代理匹配行为，研究了这种平衡条件的结构。基于Shimer和Smith（2000）中的二次搜​​索技术的“基本匹配引理”，我们为满足最小规则性条件的任何搜索技术建立了平衡条件解的存在性，唯一性和比较静态性质。指出了Shimer-Smith模型中稳态平衡的存在和结构及其扩展的含义。这进一步说明了采用二次搜索技术的搜索匹配模型的大部分结构都可以继承到更通用的搜索技术。
March 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA16427,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA16427,Time Lotteries and Stochastic Impatience,"We study preferences over lotteries in which both the prize and the payment date are uncertain. In particular, a time lottery is one in which the prize is fixed but the date is random. With Expected Discounted Utility, individuals must be risk seeking over time lotteries (RSTL). In an incentivized experiment, however, we find that almost all subjects violate this property. Our main contributions are theoretical. We first show that within a very broad class of models, which includes many forms of nonexpected utility and time discounting, it is impossible to accommodate even a single violation of RSTL without also violating a property we termed Stochastic Impatience, a risky counterpart of standard Impatience. We then present two positive results. If one wishes to maintain Stochastic Impatience, violations of RSTL can be accommodated by keeping Independence within periods while relaxing it across periods. If, instead, one is willing to forego Stochastic Impatience, violations of RSTL can be accommodated with a simple generalization of Expected Discounted Utility, obtained by imposing only the behavioral postulates of Discounted Utility and Expected Utility.",我们研究奖品和支付日期均不确定的彩票的偏好。特别地，时间彩票是一种奖品是固定的但日期是随机的彩票。使用“预期折扣公用事业”，个人必须冒着随时间推移彩票（RSTL）寻找风险的风险。但是，在激励实验中，我们发现几乎所有对象都违反了此属性。我们的主要贡献是理论上的。我们首先显示出，在包括许多形式的非预期效用和时间折扣在内的非常广泛的模型类别中，即使在不违反RSTL的特性（我们也称为随机性急躁）的情况下，也无法容纳单个RSTL违规行为， 。然后我们提出了两个积极的结果。如果希望保持随机性急躁，可以在一段时间内保持独立性，同时在各个时间段内放宽独立性，以适应违反RSTL的行为。相反，如果愿意放弃随机的不耐烦，则可以通过简单地概括“预期折扣效用”来解决违反RSTL的情况，该概括可以通过仅施加“折扣效用”和“预期效用”的行为假设来获得。
March 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA15455,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA15455,"Geography, Transportation, and Endogenous Trade Costs","In this paper, we study the role of the transportation sector in world trade. We build a spatial model that centers on the interaction of the market for (oceanic) transportation services and the market for world trade in goods. The model delivers equilibrium trade flows, as well as equilibrium trade costs (shipping prices). Using detailed data on vessel movements and shipping prices, we document novel facts about shipping patterns; we then flexibly estimate our model. We use this setup to demonstrate that the transportation sector (i) attenuates differences in the comparative advantage across countries; (ii) generates network effects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact of shocks on trade flows. These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade that was previously concealed by the frequently‐used assumption of exogenous trade costs. Finally, we illustrate how our setup can be used for policy analysis by evaluating the impact of future and existing infrastructure projects (e.g., Northwest Passage, Panama Canal).",在本文中，我们研究了运输部门在世界贸易中的作用。我们建立一个空间模型，该模型以（海洋）运输服务市场与世界货物贸易市场的相互作用为中心。该模型提供平衡贸易流量以及平衡贸易成本（运输价格）。使用有关船只移动和运输价格的详细数据，我们记录了有关运输方式的新颖事实；然后，我们可以灵活地估算模型。我们使用这种设置来证明运输部门（i）缩小了国家间比较优势的差异； （ii）在贸易成本中产生网络效应； （iii）减轻冲击对贸易流量的影响。这三种机制揭示了地理学在国际贸易中的新作用，而以前经常被假设为外生贸易成本掩盖了这一新作用。最后，我们通过评估未来和现有基础设施项目（例如西北通道，巴拿马运河）的影响，说明如何将我们的设置用于政策分析。

Using a generalized version of belief operator, we explore the restrictions that prior beliefs impose on higher order beliefs. In particular, we obtain a nontrivial lower bound on the probability of a common belief event, uniform over type spaces, when the underlying game has a monotone potential. Conversely, when the game has no monotone potential, we construct a type space with an arbitrarily high probability event in which players never have common belief about that event. As an implication of these results, we show for generic binary‐action supermodular games that an action profile is robust to incomplete information if and only if it is a monotone potential maximizer. Our study offers new methodology and insight to the analysis of global game equilibrium selection.",本文研究了二元作用超模博弈中对不完全信息的平衡的鲁棒性。使用信念运算符的广义版本，我们探索先验信念对高阶信念施加的限制。特别是，当基础游戏具有单调潜力时，我们获得了普通信念事件概率的非平凡下限，该概率在类型空间上是均匀的。相反，当游戏没有单调潜力时，我们将构建具有任意高概率事件的类型空间，在该事件中，玩家永远不会对此事件抱有共同信念。这些结果的含义是，对于通用二元作用超模块化游戏，我们证明，当且仅当它是单调潜在最大化器时，动作轮廓才对不完整信息具有鲁棒性。我们的研究为全球博弈均衡选择的分析提供了新的方法论和见识。
March 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA13734,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA13734,Diversity and Conflict,"This research advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that interpersonal population diversity, rather than fractionalization or polarization across ethnic groups, has been pivotal to the emergence, prevalence, recurrence, and severity of intrasocietal conflicts. Exploiting an exogenous source of variations in population diversity across nations and ethnic groups, as determined predominantly during the exodus of humans from Africa tens of thousands of years ago, the study demonstrates that population diversity, and its impact on the degree of diversity within ethnic groups, has contributed significantly to the risk and intensity of historical and contemporary civil conflicts. The findings arguably reflect the contribution of population diversity to the non‐cohesiveness of society, as reflected partly in the prevalence of mistrust, the divergence in preferences for public goods and redistributive policies, and the degree of fractionalization and polarization across ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups.",这项研究推进了这一假设，并凭经验建立了人际人口多样性，而不是种族间的分化或两极分化，对社会内部冲突的出现，盛行，复发和严重性至关重要。利用主要是在数万年前非洲人逃亡期间确定的，国家和族裔群体之间的人口多样性差异的外源性研究，该研究表明，人口多样性及其对族群内部多样性程度的影响，极大地增加了历史和当代内战的风险和强度。研究结果可以说反映了人口多样性对社会非凝聚力的贡献，部分反映在不信任的普遍性，对公共产品和再分配政策的偏好差异以及种族，语言和文化之间的分化程度和分化程度。宗教团体。
March 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA15749,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA15749,Arrovian Aggregation of Convex Preferences,"We consider social welfare functions that satisfy Arrow's classic axioms of independence of irrelevant alternatives and Pareto optimality when the outcome space is the convex hull of some finite set of alternatives. Individual and collective preferences are assumed to be continuous and convex, which guarantees the existence of maximal elements and the consistency of choice functions that return these elements, even without insisting on transitivity. We provide characterizations of both the domains of preferences and the social welfare functions that allow for anonymous Arrovian aggregation. The domains admit arbitrary preferences over alternatives, which completely determine an agent's preferences over all mixed outcomes. On these domains, Arrow's impossibility turns into a complete characterization of a unique social welfare function, which can be readily applied in settings involving divisible resources such as probability, time, or money.",当结果空间是某些有限选择集的凸包时，我们认为社会福利函数满足Arrow无关选择的独立性和帕累托最优性的经典公理。假定个人和集体偏好是连续的和凸的，这即使没有坚持传递性，也保证了最大元素的存在和返回这些元素的选择函数的一致性。我们提供了偏好领域和允许匿名Arrovian汇总的社会福利功能的特征。领域允许对替代方案的任意偏好，这完全决定了代理对所有混合结果的偏好。在这些领域，Arrow的不可能变成了独特的社会福利功能的完整表征，可以轻松地将其应用于涉及可分资源（例如概率，时间或金钱）的环境中。
