September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA16686,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA16686,Matching With Complementary Contracts,"In this paper, we show that stable outcomes exist in matching environments with complementarities, such as social media platforms or markets for patent licenses. Our results apply to both nontransferable and transferable utility settings, and allow for multilateral agreements and those with externalities. In particular, we show that stable outcomes in these settings are characterized by the largest fixed point of a monotone operator, and so can be found using an algorithm; in the nontransferable utility case, this is a one‐sided deferred acceptance algorithm, rather than a Gale–Shapley algorithm. We also give a monotone comparative statics result as well as a comparative static on the effect of bundling contracts together. These illustrate the impact of design decisions, such as increased privacy protections on social media, or the use of antitrust law to disallow patent pools, on stable outcomes.",在本文中，我们表明，在具有互补性的匹配环境中，例如社交媒体平台或专利许可市场，存在稳定的结果。我们的结果适用于不可转让和可转让的公用事业设置，并允许多边协议和具有外部性的协议。特别是，我们证明了在这些设置中稳定的结果以单调算子的最大不动点为特征，因此可以使用算法找到它。在不可转让的效用案例中，这是一种单面递延接受算法，而不是Gale-Shapley算法。我们还给出了单调的比较静力学结果以及将合同捆绑在一起的效果的比较静力学。这些说明了设计决策对稳定结果的影响，例如增加对社交媒体的隐私保护或使用反托拉斯法禁止专利池。
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA12558,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA12558,A Structural Econometric Analysis of Network Formation Games Through Subnetworks,"The objective of this paper is to identify and estimate network formation models using observed data on network structure. We characterize network formation as a simultaneous‐move game, where the utility from forming a link depends on the structure of the network, thereby generating strategic interactions between links. With the prevalence of multiple equilibria, the parameters are not necessarily point identified. We leave the equilibrium selection unrestricted and propose a partial identification approach. We derive bounds on the probability of observing a subnetwork, where a subnetwork is the restriction of a network to a subset of the individuals. Unlike the standard bounds as in Ciliberto and Tamer (2009), these subnetwork bounds are computationally tractable in large networks provided we consider small subnetworks. We provide Monte Carlo evidence that bounds from small subnetworks are informative in large networks.",本文的目的是使用观察到的网络结构数据来识别和估计网络形成模型。我们将网络的形成描述为同时移动游戏，其中形成链接的效用取决于网络的结构，从而在链接之间产生战略互动。由于存在多个平衡点，因此不一定必须确定参数。我们使均衡选择不受限制，并提出了部分识别方法。我们得出观察子网络的概率的界限，其中子网络是网络对个人子集的限制。与Ciliberto和Tamer（2009）中的标准范围不同，如果我们考虑小型子网，则这些子网范围在大型网络中在计算上易于处理。我们提供蒙特卡洛证据，证明小型子网的边界在大型网络中是有益的。
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA16410,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA16410,Leave‐Out Estimation of Variance Components,"We propose leave‐out estimators of quadratic forms designed for the study of linear models with unrestricted heteroscedasticity. Applications include analysis of variance and tests of linear restrictions in models with many regressors. An approximation algorithm is provided that enables accurate computation of the estimator in very large data sets. We study the large sample properties of our estimator allowing the number of regressors to grow in proportion to the number of observations. Consistency is established in a variety of settings where plug‐in methods and estimators predicated on homoscedasticity exhibit first‐order biases. For quadratic forms of increasing rank, the limiting distribution can be represented by a linear combination of normal and non‐central χ2 random variables, with normality ensuing under strong identification. Standard error estimators are proposed that enable tests of linear restrictions and the construction of uniformly valid confidence intervals for quadratic forms of interest. We find in Italian social security records that leave‐out estimates of a variance decomposition in a two‐way fixed effects model of wage determination yield substantially different conclusions regarding the relative contribution of workers, firms, and worker‐firm sorting to wage inequality than conventional methods. Monte Carlo exercises corroborate the accuracy of our asymptotic approximations, with clear evidence of non‐normality emerging when worker mobility between blocks of firms is limited.",我们提出了二次形式的遗漏估计量，该估计量设计用于研究具有无限制异方差性的线性模型。应用包括在具有许多回归变量的模型中进行方差分析和线性约束检验。提供了一种近似算法，可以在非常大的数据集中准确计算估计量。我们研究了估计量的大样本属性，从而使回归变量的数量与观测值的数量成正比。在多种设置中建立了一致性，在这些设置中，基于同调性的插件方法和估计量显示出一阶偏差。对于等级递增的二次形式，极限分布可以用正态和非中心χ2随机变量的线性组合表示，并且在强识别下可以保证正态性。提出了标准误差估计器，该标准误差估计器使得能够进行线性限制的检验以及对感兴趣的二次形式的统一有效置信区间的构造。我们在意大利的社会保障记录中发现，在工资确定的双向固定效应模型中，对方差分解的遗漏估计得出的结论是，与传统方法相比，关于工人，企业和工人公司分类对工资不平等的相对贡献大为不同方法。蒙特卡洛（Monte Carlo）的练习证实了我们渐近逼近的准确性，并且有明确的证据表明，当企业之间的工人流动性受到限制时，就会出现非正态性。
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA14234,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA14234,Paralyzed by Fear: Rigid and Discrete Pricing Under Demand Uncertainty,"We propose a new theory of price rigidity based on firms' Knightian uncertainty about their competitive environment. This uncertainty has two key implications. First, firms learn about the shape of their demand function from past observations of quantities sold. This learning gives rise to kinks in the expected profit function at previously observed prices, making those prices both sticky and more likely to reoccur. Second, uncertainty about the relationship between aggregate and industry‐level inflation generates nominal rigidity. We prove the main insights analytically and quantify the effects of our mechanism. Our estimated quantitative model is consistent with a wide range of micro‐level pricing facts that are typically challenging to match jointly. It also implies significantly more persistent monetary non‐neutrality than in standard models, allowing it to generate large real effects from nominal shocks.",我们基于企业对​​竞争环境的奈特不确定性提出了一种新的价格刚性理论。这种不确定性具有两个关键含义。首先，企业从过去对销售数量的观察中了解需求函数的形式。这种学习会导致以先前观察到的价格出现预期利润函数中的扭结，使这些价格既发粘又很可能再次出现。其次，总和通货膨胀之间关系的不确定性会产生名义刚性。我们通过分析证明主要见解，并量化我们机制的影响。我们估算的量化模型与各种微观定价事实相吻合，这些挑战通常很难共同匹配。与标准模型相比，这也意味着货币非中立性要持久得多，从而使其能够从名义冲击中产生较大的实际影响。
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA15530,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA15530,Non‐Clairvoyant Dynamic Mechanism Design,"We introduce a new family of dynamic mechanisms that restricts sellers from using future distributional knowledge. Since the allocation and pricing of each auction period do not depend on the type distributions of future periods, we call this family of dynamic mechanisms non‐clairvoyant.
      We develop a framework (bank account mechanisms) for characterizing, designing, and proving lower bounds for dynamic mechanisms (clairvoyant or non‐clairvoyant). We use the same methods to compare the revenue extraction power of clairvoyant and non‐clairvoyant dynamic mechanisms.","我们引入了一系列新的动态机制，这些机制限制了卖方使用未来的分销知识。由于每个拍卖周期的分配和定价都不取决于未来周期的类型分布，因此我们称这种动态机制为非透视机制。
      我们开发了一个框架（银行帐户机制），用于描述，设计和证明动态机制（透视或非透视）的下限。我们使用相同的方法比较千里眼和非千里眼动态机制的收益提取能力。"
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA15828,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA15828,Eliminating Uncertainty in Market Access: The Impact of New Bridges in Rural Nicaragua,"We measure the impact of increasing integration between rural villages and outside labor markets. Seasonal flash floods cause exogenous and unpredictable loss of market access. We study the impact of new bridges that eliminate this risk. Identification exploits variation in riverbank characteristics that preclude bridge construction in some villages, despite similar need. We collect detailed annual household surveys over three years, and weekly telephone followups to study contemporaneous effects of flooding. Floods decrease labor market income by 18 percent when no bridge is present. Bridges eliminate this effect. The indirect effects on labor market choice, farm investment, and savings are quantitatively important and consistent with the predictions of a general equilibrium model in which farm investment is risky, and households manage labor market risk and agricultural risk simultaneously. In the calibrated model, the increase in consumption‐equivalent welfare is substantially larger than the increase in income due to the ability to mitigate risk.",我们评估了乡村与外部劳动力市场之间日益融合的影响。季节性山洪导致市场准入的外生性和不可预测的损失。我们研究了消除这种风险的新桥梁的影响。识别利用了河岸特征的变化，尽管有类似的需求，但这些变化阻止了一些村庄的桥梁建设。我们收集三年来的详细年度家庭调查，并每周进行电话跟进，以研究洪水的同期影响。如果没有桥梁，洪水会使劳动力市场收入减少18％。桥接消除了这种影响。对劳动力市场选择，农场投资和储蓄的间接影响在数量上很重要，并且与对农业投资有风险，家庭同时管理劳动力市场风险和农业风险的一般均衡模型的预测相一致。在校准模型中，由于具有降低风险的能力，因此，等同于消费的福利的增长远大于收入的增长。
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA16327,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA16327,Segmentary Lineage Organization and Conflict in Sub‐Saharan Africa,"We test the longstanding hypothesis that ethnic groups organized around “segmentary lineages” are more prone to conflict. Ethnographic accounts suggest that in such societies, which are characterized by strong allegiances to distant relatives, individuals are obligated to come to the aid of fellow lineage members when they become involved in conflicts. As a consequence, small disagreements often escalate into larger‐scale conflicts involving many individuals. We test for a link between segmentary lineage organization and conflict across ethnic groups in sub‐Saharan Africa. Using a number of estimation strategies, including a regression discontinuity design at ethnic boundaries, we find that segmentary lineage societies experience more conflicts, and particularly ones that are retaliatory, long in duration, and large in scale.",我们检验了长期存在的假说，即围绕“细分血统”组织的种族群体更容易发生冲突。人种学记载表明，在这样的社会中，对远方亲属的忠诚度很高，当人们卷入冲突时，个人有义务向同族谱系成员提供帮助。结果，小的分歧通常会升级为涉及许多个人的大规模冲突。我们测试了分段血统组织与撒哈拉以南非洲各族裔之间的冲突之间的联系。通过使用多种估计策略，包括在种族边界上进行回归不连续性设计，我们发现分段宗族社会经历了更多的冲突，尤其是报复性，持续时间长且规模大的冲突。
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA15565,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA15565,"Heterogeneous Markups, Growth, and Endogenous Misallocation","Markups vary systematically across firms and are a source of misallocation. This paper develops a tractable model of firm dynamics where firms' market power is endogenous and the distribution of markups emerges as an equilibrium outcome. Monopoly power is the result of a process of forward‐looking, risky accumulation: firms invest in productivity growth to increase markups in their existing products but are stochastically replaced by more efficient competitors. Creative destruction therefore has pro‐competitive effects because faster churn gives firms less time to accumulate market power. In an application to firm‐level data from Indonesia, the model predicts that, relative to the United States, misallocation is more severe and firms are substantially smaller. To explain these patterns, the model suggests an important role for frictions that prevent existing firms from entering new markets. Differences in entry costs for new firms are less important.",各个公司的加价幅度存在系统差异，这是分配错误的根源。本文建立了一个简单的企业动力学模型，其中企业的市场力量是内生的，加价的分布是均衡结果。垄断力量是前瞻性风险积累过程的结果：企业投资于生产力增长以增加其现有产品的加价幅度，但被效率更高的竞争对手随机取代。因此，创意毁灭具有竞争优势，因为更快的流失速度使企业更少的时间来积累市场力量。在印度尼西亚的企业级数据的应用中，该模型预测，相对于美国，分配不当的情况更加严重，而企业的规模实际上要小得多。为了解释这些模式，该模型提出了防止现有公司进入新市场的摩擦的重要作用。新公司进入成本的差异不那么重要。
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA16475,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA16475,Optimal Monitoring Design,"This paper considers a Principal–Agent model with hidden action in which the Principal can monitor the Agent by acquiring independent signals conditional on effort at a constant marginal cost. The Principal aims to implement a target effort level at minimal cost. The main result of the paper is that the optimal information‐acquisition strategy is a two‐threshold policy and, consequently, the equilibrium contract specifies two possible wages for the Agent. This result provides a rationale for the frequently observed single‐bonus wage contracts.",本文考虑了具有隐藏动作的委托人-代理模型，委托人可以通过以恒定的边际成本获取以工作量为条件的独立信号来监视代理。校长旨在以最小的成本实现目标工作量。本文的主要结果是，最优的信息获取策略是一个两阈值策略，因此，均衡合同为代理指定了两种可能的工资。该结果为经常观察到的单奖金工资合同提供了依据。
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA13660,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA13660,"Dynamic Spatial Panel Models: Networks, Common Shocks, and Sequential Exogeneity","This paper considers a class of generalized methods of moments (GMM) estimators for general dynamic panel models, allowing for weakly exogenous covariates and cross‐sectional dependence due to spatial lags, unspecified common shocks, and time‐varying interactive effects. We significantly expand the scope of the existing literature by allowing for endogenous time‐varying spatial weight matrices without imposing explicit structural assumptions on how the weights are formed. An important area of application is in social interaction and network models where our specification can accommodate data dependent network formation. We consider an exemplary social interaction model and show how identification of the interaction parameters is achieved through a combination of linear and quadratic moment conditions. For the general setup we develop an orthogonal forward differencing transformation to aid in the estimation of factor components while maintaining orthogonality of moment conditions. This is an important ingredient to a tractable asymptotic distribution of our estimators. In general, the asymptotic distribution of our estimators is found to be mixed normal due to random norming. However, the asymptotic distribution of our test statistics is still chi‐square.",本文考虑了用于一般动态面板模型的一类广义矩估计方法（GMM），由于空间滞后，未指定的常见冲击和时变交互作用，允许弱外生协变量和横截面依赖性。通过允许使用内生时变的空间权重矩阵，而无需对权重的形成方式施加明确的结构假设，我们大大扩展了现有文献的范围。应用程序的一个重要领域是社交互动和网络模型，我们的规范可以适应依赖数据的网络形成。我们考虑一个示例性的社交互动模型，并说明如何通过线性和二次矩条件的组合来实现对互动参数的识别。对于一般设置，我们开发了正交正向差分变换，以帮助估计因子分量，同时保持矩条件的正交性。这是估计量的渐近分布的重要组成部分。通常，由于随机范数，我们的估计量的渐近分布被发现是正态混合的。但是，我们的检验统计量的渐近分布仍然是卡方。
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA16273,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA16273,Analysis of Testing‐Based Forward Model Selection,"This paper analyzes a procedure called Testing‐Based Forward Model Selection (TBFMS) in linear regression problems. This procedure inductively selects covariates that add predictive power into a working statistical model before estimating a final regression. The criterion for deciding which covariate to include next and when to stop including covariates is derived from a profile of traditional statistical hypothesis tests. This paper proves probabilistic bounds, which depend on the quality of the tests, for prediction error and the number of selected covariates. As an example, the bounds are then specialized to a case with heteroscedastic data, with tests constructed with the help of Huber–Eicker–White standard errors. Under the assumed regularity conditions, these tests lead to estimation convergence rates matching other common high‐dimensional estimators including Lasso.",本文分析了线性回归问题中称为基于测试的前向模型选择（TBFMS）的过程。该过程以归纳方式选择在预测最终回归之前将预测能力添加到工作统计模型中的协变量。决定接下来要包含哪个协变量以及何时停止包含协变量的标准是从传统统计假设检验的概况中得出的。本文证明了概率界限，该界限取决于测试的质量，预测误差和所选协变量的数量。例如，然后将边界专门用于具有异方差数据的情况，并借助Huber–Eicker–White标准误差构建测试。在假定的规律性条件下，这些测试导致估计收敛速度与包括Lasso在内的其他常见高维估计量匹配。
September 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA16584,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA16584,Reputation Effects Under Interdependent Values,"A patient player privately observes a persistent state and interacts with an infinite sequence of myopic uninformed players. The patient player is either a strategic type who maximizes his payoff or one of several commitment types who mechanically play the same action in every period. I focus on situations in which the uninformed player's best reply to a commitment action depends on the state and where the total probability of commitment types is sufficiently small. I show that the patient player's equilibrium payoff is bounded below his commitment payoff in some equilibria under some of his payoff functions. This is because he faces a trade‐off between building his reputation for commitment and signaling favorable information about the state. When players' stage‐game payoff functions are monotone‐supermodular, the patient player receives high payoffs in all states and in all equilibria. Under an additional condition on the state distribution, my reputation model yields a unique prediction on the patient player's equilibrium payoff and on‐path behavior.",耐心的玩家会私下观察一个持续状态，并与无限次近视无知玩家互动。患者参与者要么是最大化其回报的战略类型，要么是在每个周期中机械地执行相同动作的几种承诺类型之一。我关注的情况是，不知情的玩家对承诺行动的最佳答复取决于状态，并且承诺类型的总概率足够小。我证明病人球员的均衡收益在他的某些收益函数下，在一定的平衡下会低于他的承诺收益。这是因为他要在树立承诺声誉和传达有关国家的有利信息之间进行权衡。当玩家的阶段游戏收益函数是单调超模块化时，耐心的球员在所有状态和所有均衡中都将获得高收益。在状态分布的附加条件下，我的声誉模型对患者行为者的平衡收益和在途行为产生了唯一的预测。

For estimators of this kind, the standard nonparametric bootstrap is inconsistent. The method proposed herein is based on the nonparametric bootstrap, but restores consistency by altering the shape of the criterion function defining the estimator whose distribution we seek to approximate. This modification leads to a generic and easy‐to‐implement resampling method for inference that is conceptually distinct from other available distributional approximations. We illustrate the applicability of our results with four examples in econometrics and machine learning.",本文为表现出Chernoff（1964）型极限分布的M估计量提出了一个有效的基于Bootstrap的分布逼近。对于这种估计器，标准的非参数引导程序是不一致的。本文提出的方法基于非参数引导程序，但通过更改定义估计值的标准函数的形状来恢复一致性，该估计值的分布我们试图近似。这种修改导致了一种通用且易于实现的推理重采样方法，该方法在概念上与其他可用的分布近似值不同。我们通过计量经济学和机器学习中的四个示例来说明我们的结果的适用性。
