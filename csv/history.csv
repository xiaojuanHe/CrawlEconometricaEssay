January 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA14407,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA14407,Testing Models of Social Learning on Networks: Evidence From Two Experiments,"We theoretically and empirically study an incomplete information model of social learning. Agents initially guess the binary state of the world after observing a private signal. In subsequent rounds, agents observe their network neighbors' previous guesses before guessing again. Agents are drawn from a mixture of learning types—Bayesian, who face incomplete information about others' types, and DeGroot, who average their neighbors' previous period guesses and follow the majority. We study (1) learning features of both types of agents in our incomplete information model; (2) what network structures lead to failures of asymptotic learning; (3) whether realistic networks exhibit such structures. We conducted lab experiments with 665 subjects in Indian villages and 350 students from ITAM in Mexico. We perform a reduced‐form analysis and then structurally estimate the mixing parameter, finding the share of Bayesian agents to be 10% and 50% in the Indian‐villager and Mexican‐student samples, respectively.",我们在理论和经验上研究了不完整的社会学习信息模型。代理程序在观察到专用信号后最初会猜测世界的二进制状态。在随后的回合中，代理在再次猜测之前观察其网络邻居的先前猜测。代理人来自多种学习类型，其中贝叶斯（Bayesian）面临着关于他人类型的不完整信息，而德格鲁特（DeGroot）对邻居的前期猜测进行平均并遵循大多数。我们研究（1）在不完整的信息模型中两种类型的主体的学习特征； （2）哪些网络结构导致渐进学习失败； （3）现实网络是否表现出这种结构。我们对印度村庄的665个主题和墨西哥ITAM的350名学生进行了实验。我们执行简化形式的分析，然后在结构上估计混合参数，发现印度裔和墨西哥裔学生样本中贝叶斯代理的份额分别为10％和50％。
January 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA15899,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA15899,Endogenous Production Networks,"We develop a tractable model of endogenous production networks. Each one of a number of products can be produced by combining labor and an endogenous subset of the other products as inputs. Different combinations of inputs generate (prespecified) levels of productivity and various distortions may affect costs and prices. We establish the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium and provide comparative static results on how prices and endogenous technology/input choices (and thus the production network) respond to changes in parameters. These results show that improvements in technology (or reductions in distortions) spread throughout the economy via input–output linkages and reduce all prices, and under reasonable restrictions on the menu of production technologies, also lead to a denser production network. Using a dynamic version of the model, we establish that the endogenous evolution of the production network could be a powerful force towards sustained economic growth. At the root of this result is the fact that the arrival of a few new products expands the set of technological possibilities of all existing industries by a large amount—that is, if there are n products, the arrival of one more new product increases the combinations of inputs that each existing product can use from 2n−1 to 2n, thus enabling significantly more pronounced cost reductions from choice of input combinations. These cost reductions then spread to other industries via lower input prices and incentivize them to also adopt additional inputs.",我们开发了内生性生产网络的易处理模型。可以通过将人工和其他产品的内生子集作为投入组合来生产多种产品中的每一种。投入的不同组合会产生（预定的）生产率水平，各种失真可能会影响成本和价格。我们建立了均衡的存在和唯一性，并提供了关于价格和内生技术/投入选择（以及生产网络）如何响应参数变化的比较静态结果。这些结果表明，技术的改进（或失真的减少）通过投入－产出的联系在整个经济中蔓延，并降低了所有价格，并且在生产技术菜单的合理限制下，也导致了生产网络的密集。使用该模型的动态版本，我们确定生产网络的内生演化可能是实现持续经济增长的强大力量。这一结果的根源在于，一些新产品的到来大大扩展了所有现有行业的技术可能性，也就是说，如果有n种产品，那么又有一个新产品的到来将增加每个现有产品可以使用的输入组合从2n-1到2n，因此可以通过选择输入组合显着降低成本。这些降低的成本随后通过较低的投入价格传播到其他行业，并激励他们也采用其他投入。
January 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA14044,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA14044,The Global Diffusion of Ideas,"We provide a tractable, quantitatively‐oriented theory of innovation and technology diffusion to explore the role of international trade in the process of development. We model innovation and diffusion as a process involving the combination of new ideas with insights from other industries or countries. We provide conditions under which each country's equilibrium frontier of knowledge converges to a Fréchet distribution, and derive a system of differential equations describing the evolution of the scale parameters of these distributions, that is, countries' stocks of knowledge. The model remains tractable with many asymmetric countries and generates a rich set of predictions about how the level and composition of trade affect countries' frontiers of knowledge. We use the framework to quantify the contribution of bilateral trade costs to long‐run changes in TFP and individual post‐war growth miracles. For our preferred calibration, we find that both gains from trade and the fraction of variation of TFP growth accounted for by changes in trade more than double relative to a model without diffusion.",我们提供了一种易于处理，以数量为导向的创新和技术扩散理论，以探讨国际贸易在发展过程中的作用。我们将创新和扩散建模为一个过程，将新思想与其他行业或国家的见解相结合。我们提供了每个国家的知识均衡前沿收敛于Fréchet分布的条件，并推导了描述这些分布的规模参数（即国家知识储备）演化的微分方程组。该模型在许多不对称国家中仍然易于处理，并且就贸易的水平和构成如何影响国家的知识边界产生了一系列丰富的预测。我们使用该框架来量化双边贸易成本对TFP长期变化和战后个人增长奇迹的贡献。对于我们的首选校准，我们发现相对于没有扩散的模型，贸易的收益和TFP增长的变化所占的百分比都由贸易的变化造成的。
January 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA14835,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA14835,Heterogeneity and Persistence in Returns to Wealth,"We provide a systematic analysis of the properties of individual returns to wealth using 12 years of population data from Norway's administrative tax records. We document a number of novel results. First, individuals earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1%) and on its components. Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even within narrow asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net‐of‐tax returns). Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent. Finally, wealth returns are correlated across generations. We discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the wealth inequality debate.",我们使用来自挪威行政税收记录的12年人口数据，对个人财富回报的特性进行了系统的分析。我们记录了许多新颖的结果。首先，个人的净资产（标准差为22.1％）及其组成部分的平均回报率明显不同。其次，收益的异质性不仅仅来自安全资产和风险资产之间财富分配的差异：即使在狭窄的资产类别中，收益也是异质的。第三，回报与财富呈正相关：从净值分配的第10个百分位数上升到第90个百分位数，可使回报增加18个百分点（如果查看税后净回报，则增加10个百分点）。第四，随着时间的流逝，个人财富回报表现出实质性的持久性。我们认为，虽然这种持久性部分源于风险敞口和资产规模的稳定差异，但它也反映了复杂程度和财务信息以及企业家才能的异质性。最后，财富回报与各代人相关。我们讨论了这些发现对财富不平等辩论的几方面的影响。
January 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA14952,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA14952,Forecasting With Dynamic Panel Data Models,"This paper considers the problem of forecasting a collection of short time series using cross‐sectional information in panel data. We construct point predictors using Tweedie's formula for the posterior mean of heterogeneous coefficients under a correlated random effects distribution. This formula utilizes cross‐sectional information to transform the unit‐specific (quasi) maximum likelihood estimator into an approximation of the posterior mean under a prior distribution that equals the population distribution of the random coefficients. We show that the risk of a predictor based on a nonparametric kernel estimate of the Tweedie correction is asymptotically equivalent to the risk of a predictor that treats the correlated random effects distribution as known (ratio optimality). Our empirical Bayes predictor performs well compared to various competitors in a Monte Carlo study. In an empirical application, we use the predictor to forecast revenues for a large panel of bank holding companies and compare forecasts that condition on actual and severely adverse macroeconomic conditions.",本文考虑了使用面板数据中的横截面信息来预测短时间序列集合的问题。我们在相关随机效应分布下，使用Tweedie公式构造异质系数的后均值的点预测变量。该公式利用横截面信息将特定于单位的（拟）最大似然估计值转换为等于随机系数总体分布的先验分布下的后均值近似值。我们显示，基于Tweedie校正的非参数内核估计的预测变量的风险渐近等效于将相关随机效应分布视为已知的预测变量的风险（比率最优性）。与蒙特卡洛研究中的各种竞争对手相比，我们的经验贝叶斯预测指标表现良好。在经验应用中，我们使用预测器预测大型银行控股公司的收入，并比较在实际和严重不利的宏观经济条件下的预测。
January 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA17428,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA17428,Savage's P3 Is Redundant,"Savage (1954) provided the first axiomatic characterization of expected utility without relying on any given probabilities or utilities. It is the most famous preference axiomatization existing. This note shows that Savage's axiom P3 is implied by the other axioms, which reveals its redundancy. It is remarkable that this was not noticed before as Savage's axiomatization has been studied and taught by hundreds of researchers for more than six decades.",Savage（1954）在不依赖任何给定的概率或效用的情况下，首次对期望效用进行公理化表征。这是现有的最著名的偏好公理化。此注释表明Savage的公理P3被其他公理所隐含，这表明了它的冗余性。值得注意的是，由于Savage的公理化研究已由数百名研究人员进行了六十多年的研究和讲授，因此并未引起人们的注意。
January 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA13918,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA13918,Nonlinear Pricing in Village Economies,"This paper examines the prices of basic staples in rural Mexico. We document that nonlinear pricing in the form of quantity discounts is common, that quantity discounts are sizable for basic staples, and that the well‐known conditional cash transfer program Progresa has significantly increased quantity discounts, although the program, as documented in previous studies, has not affected unit prices on average. To account for these patterns, we propose a model of price discrimination that nests those of Maskin and Riley (1984) and Jullien (2000), in which consumers differ in their tastes and, because of subsistence constraints, in their ability to pay for a good. We show that under mild conditions, a model in which consumers face heterogeneous subsistence or budget constraints is equivalent to one in which consumers have access to heterogeneous outside options. We rely on known results to characterize the equilibrium price schedule, which is nonlinear in quantity. We analyze the effect of nonlinear pricing on market participation as well as the impact of a market‐wide transfer, analogous to the Progresa one, when consumers are differentially constrained. We show that the model is structurally identified from data on prices and quantities from a single market under common assumptions. We estimate the model using data on three commonly consumed commodities from municipalities and localities in Mexico. Interestingly, we find that relative to linear pricing, nonlinear pricing is beneficial to a large number of households, including those consuming small quantities, mostly because of the higher degree of market participation that nonlinear pricing induces. We also show that the Progresa transfer has affected the slopes of the price schedules of the three commodities we study, which have become steeper as consistent with our model, leading to an increase in the intensity of price discrimination. Finally, we find that a reduced form of our model, in which the size of quantity discounts depends on the hazard rate of the distribution of quantities purchased in a village, accounts for the shift in price schedules induced by the program.",本文研究了墨西哥农村地区基本食品的价格。我们证明，以数量折扣的形式进行非线性定价是很常见的，基本商品的数量折扣相当可观，并且众所周知的有条件现金转移计划Progresa大大提高了数量折扣，尽管该计划如先前的研究所述，并未平均影响单价。为了解释这些模式，我们提出了一种价格歧视模型，该模型嵌套了Maskin和Riley（1984）和Jullien（2000）的模型，在这种模型中，消费者的口味不同，并且由于生存的限制，他们支付商品价格的能力也不同。好。我们表明，在温和的条件下，一种模型，其中消费者面临多样化的生存或预算约束，这种模型等同于一种模型，其中消费者可以使用多种外部选择。我们依靠已知的结果来表征均衡价格计划，该价格计划是非线性的。我们分析了非线性定价对市场参与的影响，以及当消费者受到差异约束时类似于Progresa的市场范围转移的影响。我们表明，该模型是在相同的假设下从单个市场的价格和数量数据中确定的。我们使用来自墨西哥各市和地方的三种常见消费商品的数据估算模型。有趣的是，我们发现相对于线性定价，非线性定价对大量家庭（包括消费少量家庭）有好处，这主要是由于非线性定价所引起的更高的市场参与度。我们还表明，Progresa转移影响了我们研究的三种商品的价格时间表的斜率，与我们的模型一致，斜率变得越来越陡峭，导致价格歧视的强度增加了。最后，我们发现我们模型的简化形式，其中数量折扣的大小取决于村庄购买数量分布的危害率，解释了该计划引起的价格计划的变化。
January 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA12675,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA12675,Sampling‐Based versus Design‐Based Uncertainty in Regression Analysis,"Consider a researcher estimating the parameters of a regression function based on data for all 50 states in the United States or on data for all visits to a website. What is the interpretation of the estimated parameters and the standard errors? In practice, researchers typically assume that the sample is randomly drawn from a large population of interest and report standard errors that are designed to capture sampling variation. This is common even in applications where it is difficult to articulate what that population of interest is, and how it differs from the sample. In this article, we explore an alternative approach to inference, which is partly design‐based. In a design‐based setting, the values of some of the regressors can be manipulated, perhaps through a policy intervention. Design‐based uncertainty emanates from lack of knowledge about the values that the regression outcome would have taken under alternative interventions. We derive standard errors that account for design‐based uncertainty instead of, or in addition to, sampling‐based uncertainty. We show that our standard errors in general are smaller than the usual infinite‐population sampling‐based standard errors and provide conditions under which they coincide.",考虑一个研究人员根据美国所有50个州的数据或网站的所有访问数据估算回归函数的参数。估计参数和标准误差的解释是什么？在实践中，研究人员通常假定样本是从大量目标人群中随机抽取的，并报告旨在捕获样本变化的标准误差。即使在很难阐明感兴趣的人群是什么以及与样本有何不同的应用中，这也是常见的。在本文中，我们探索了另一种推理方法，该方法部分基于设计。在基于设计的设置中，可以通过策略干预来操纵某些回归变量的值。基于设计的不确定性源于对回归结果在替代干预下应采用的值的了解不足。我们得出标准误差，这些误差解释了基于设计的不确定性，而不是基于采样的不确定性，或者是基于采样的不确定性。我们表明，我们的标准误差通常小于通常的基于无限人口抽样的标准误差，并提供了它们一致的条件。
January 2020,/doi/10.3982/ECTA15604,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA15604,Informational Channels of Financial Contagion,"Two main classes of channels are studied as informational sources of financial contagion. One is a fundamental channel that is based on real and financial links between economies, and the second is a social learning channel that arises when agents base their decisions on noisy observations about the actions of others in foreign markets. Using global games, I present a two‐country model of financial contagion in which both channels can operate and I test its predictions experimentally. The experimental results show that subjects do not extract information optimally, which leads to two systematic biases that affect these channels directly. Base‐rate neglect leads subjects to underweight their prior, and thus weakens the fundamental channel. An overreaction bias strengthens the social learning channel, since subjects rely on information about the behavior of others, even when this information is irrelevant. These results have significant welfare effects rooted in the specific way in which these biases alter behavior.",研究了两个主要类别的渠道，作为金融危机蔓延的信息来源。一个是建立在经济体之间实际和财务联系基础上的基本渠道，第二是当代理人基于对他人在国外市场上的行为的嘈杂观察做出决策时出现的社会学习渠道。通过使用全球博弈，我提出了一种金融传染的两国模型，两个渠道都可以在其中运作，并且我通过实验来检验其预测。实验结果表明，对象不能最佳地提取信息，这导致直接影响这些渠道的两个系统性偏差。忽略基本费率会导致受试者降低其先前的体重，从而削弱了基本渠道。过度反应的偏见会加强社会学习渠道，因为即使这些信息无关紧要，受试者也依赖于有关他人行为的信息。这些结果具有重大的福利效应，其根源在于这些偏见改变行为的特定方式。
