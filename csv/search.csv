We characterize network formation as a simultaneousâ€�move game, where the utility from forming a link depends on the structure of the network, thereby generating strategic interactions between links. With the prevalence of multiple equilibria, the parameters are not necessarily point identified. We leave the equilibrium selection unrestricted and propose a partial identification approach. We derive bounds on the probability of observing a subnetwork, where a subnetwork is the restriction of a network to a subset of the individuals. Unlike the standard bounds as in Ciliberto and Tamer (2009), these subnetwork bounds are computationally tractable in large networks provided we consider small subnetworks. We provide Monte Carlo evidence that bounds from small subnetworks are informative in large networks.",本文的目的是使用观察到的网络结构数据来识别和估计网络形成模型。我们将网络形成的特征描述为同步移动游戏，其中形成链接的实用程序取决于网络的结构，从而在链接之间产生战略互动。由于存在多个平衡点，因此不一定必须确定参数。我们使均衡选择不受限制，并提出了部分识别方法。我们得出观察子网络的概率的界限，其中子网络是网络对个人子集的限制。与Ciliberto和Tamer（2009）中的标准范围不同，如果我们考虑小型子网，则这些子网范围在大型网络中在计算上易于处理。我们提供蒙特卡洛证据，证明小型子网的边界在大型网络中是有益的。

We suppose that a link with another agent allows access, in part and in due course, to the benefits available to the latter via his own links. Thus individual links generate externalities whose value depends on the level of decay/delay associated with indirect links. A distinctive aspect of our approach is that the costs of link formation are incurred only by the person who initiates the link. This allows us to formulate the network formation process as a noncooperative game. We first provide a characterization of the architecture of equilibrium networks. We then study the dynamics of network formation. We find that individual efforts to access benefits offered by others lead, rapidly, to the emergence of an equilibrium social network, under a variety of circumstances. The limiting networks have simple architectures, e.g., the wheel, the star, or generalizations of these networks. In many cases, such networks are also socially efficient.",我们提出了一种基于以下概念的网络形成方法：社交网络是由个体决策形成的，这些决策权衡了建立和维护链接的成本与这样做的潜在回报之间的权衡。我们假设与另一个代理的链接允许部分和适当时候通过他自己的链接访问后者所能获得的利益。因此，各个链接会产生外部性，其价值取决于与间接链接相关的衰减/延迟级别。我们方法的一个独特方面是，链接建立的成本仅由发起链接的人承担。这使我们可以将网络形成过程表述为非合作博弈。我们首先提供平衡网络架构的特征。然后，我们研究网络形成的动力学。我们发现，在各种情况下，个人为获取他人提供的利益所做的努力会迅速导致均衡社会网络的出现。限制网络具有简单的架构，例如，车轮，星形或这些网络的概括。在许多情况下，这样的网络在社会上也是有效的。

Payoffs depend on direct links, but also link externalities. Players meet sequentially at random, myopically updating their links. Under mild assumptions, the network formation process is a potential game and converges to an exponential random graph model (ERGM), generating directed dense networks. I provide new identification results for ERGMs in large networks: if link externalities are nonnegative, the ERGM is asymptotically indistinguishable from an Erdős–Rényi model with independent links. We can identify the parameters only when at least one of the externalities is negative and sufficiently large. However, the standard estimation methods for ERGMs can have exponentially slow convergence, even when the model has asymptotically independent links. I thus estimate parameters using a Bayesian MCMC method. When the parameters are identifiable, I show evidence that the estimation algorithm converges in almost quadratic time.",本文提出了结合战略和随机网络特征的网络形成的经验模型。收益不仅取决于直接链接，还取决于链接的外部性。玩家随机顺序开会，近距离地更新他们的链接。在温和的假设下，网络形成过程是一个潜在的博弈，并会收敛到指数随机图模型（ERGM），从而生成有向密集网络。我为大型网络中的ERGM提供了新的识别结果：如果链路外部性非负，则ERGM与具有独立链路的Erdős-Rényi模型在渐近性上是无法区分的。只有当至少一个外部性为负且足够大时，我们才能确定参数。但是，即使模型具有渐近独立的链接，用于ERGM的标准估计方法也会具有指数级的收敛速度。因此，我使用贝叶斯MCMC方法估计参数。当参数可识别时，我证明了估计算法在几乎二次时间内收敛。

We show that, as the economy becomes more disaggregated, the rate at which aggregate volatility decays is determined by the structure of the network capturing such linkages. Our main results provide a characterization of this relationship in terms of the importance of different sectors as suppliers to their immediate customers, as well as their role as indirect suppliers to chains of downstream sectors. Such higher‐order interconnections capture the possibility of “cascade effects” whereby productivity shocks to a sector propagate not only to its immediate downstream customers, but also to the rest of the economy. Our results highlight that sizable aggregate volatility is obtained from sectoral idiosyncratic shocks only if there exists significant asymmetry in the roles that sectors play as suppliers to others, and that the “sparseness” of the input–output matrix is unrelated to the nature of aggregate fluctuations.",本文认为，在存在部门间投入产出联系的情况下，微观经济特质的冲击可能会导致总体波动。我们表明，随着经济的进一步分解，总波动率的下降速率取决于捕获这种联系的网络结构。我们的主要结果从不同部门作为其直接客户的供应商的重要性以及它们作为下游部门链的间接供应商的角色方面描述了这种关系。这种更高级别的互连捕获了“级联效应”的可能性，由此，对一个部门的生产率冲击不仅会传播到其直接下游客户，还会传播到整个经济领域。我们的结果表明，只有当部门作为他人的供应者所扮演的角色存在显着的不对称性，且部门间特有的冲击才能获得相当大的总体波动性，并且投入产出矩阵的“稀疏性”与总体波动的性质无关。

Like in fixed effects panel data analyses, the joint distribution of observed and unobserved agent‐level characteristics is left unrestricted. Two estimators for the (common) homophily parameter, β0, are developed and their properties studied under an asymptotic sequence involving a single network growing large. The first, tetrad logit (TL), estimator conditions on a sufficient statistic for the degree heterogeneity. The second, joint maximum likelihood (JML), estimator treats the degree heterogeneity {Ai0}i = 1N as additional (incidental) parameters to be estimated. The TL estimate is consistent under both sparse and dense graph sequences, whereas consistency of the JML estimate is shown only under dense graph sequences.",我介绍了一种无向二元链接形成的模型，该模型允许对观察到的代理特征（同质性）进行分类匹配，以及链接剩余中不受限制的代理级别异质性（程度异质性）。像固定效果面板数据分析中一样，观察到的和未观察到的特工级特征的联合分布不受限制。 （同）同构参数β0的两个估计量被开发出来，并且在一个渐近序列下研究它们的性质，该渐近序列包括一个逐渐增大的单个网络。第一个四元对数（TL）估计器条件基于度异质性的足够统计量。第二个联合最大似然（JML）估计器将程度异质性{Ai0} i = 1N视为要估计的其他（偶然）参数。 TL估计在稀疏图序列和稠密图序列下都是一致的，而JML估计的一致性仅在稠密图序列下才显示。

An important special case of our setup is the two‐way regression model. This is a workhorse technique in the analysis of matched data sets, such as employer–employee or student–teacher panel data. We formalize how the structure of the network affects the accuracy with which the fixed effects can be estimated. This allows us to derive sufficient conditions on the network for consistent estimation and asymptotically valid inference to be possible. Estimation of moments is also considered. We allow for general networks and our setup covers both the dense and the sparse case. We provide numerical results for the estimation of teacher value‐added models and regressions with occupational dummies.",本文考虑了根据网络数据估算的线性回归模型中对固定效应的推断。我们的设置的一个重要特例是双向回归模型。这是分析匹配的数据集（例如，雇主-雇员或学生-老师面板数据）中的主力技术。我们将网络的结构形式化如何影响可估计固定效应的准确性。这使我们能够在网络上得出足够的条件，以便进行一致的估计和渐近有效的推断。还考虑了弯矩的估算。我们允许使用通用网络，并且我们的设置涵盖了密集情况和稀疏情况。我们提供了数值结果，用于估算教师增值模型和职业假人的回归。

Each one of a number of products can be produced by combining labor and an endogenous subset of the other products as inputs. Different combinations of inputs generate (prespecified) levels of productivity and various distortions may affect costs and prices. We establish the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium and provide comparative static results on how prices and endogenous technology/input choices (and thus the production network) respond to changes in parameters. These results show that improvements in technology (or reductions in distortions) spread throughout the economy via input–output linkages and reduce all prices, and under reasonable restrictions on the menu of production technologies, also lead to a denser production network. Using a dynamic version of the model, we establish that the endogenous evolution of the production network could be a powerful force towards sustained economic growth. At the root of this result is the fact that the arrival of a few new products expands the set of technological possibilities of all existing industries by a large amount—that is, if there are n products, the arrival of one more new product increases the combinations of inputs that each existing product can use from 2n−1 to 2n, thus enabling significantly more pronounced cost reductions from choice of input combinations. These cost reductions then spread to other industries via lower input prices and incentivize them to also adopt additional inputs.",我们开发了内生性生产网络的易处理模型。可以通过将人工和其他产品的内生子集作为投入组合来生产多种产品中的每一种。投入的不同组合会产生（预定的）生产率水平，各种失真可能会影响成本和价格。我们建立了均衡的存在和唯一性，并提供了关于价格和内生技术/投入选择（以及生产网络）如何响应参数变化的比较静态结果。这些结果表明，技术的改进（或失真的减少）通过投入－产出的联系在整个经济中蔓延，并降低了所有价格，并且在生产技术菜单的合理限制下，也导致了生产网络的密集。使用该模型的动态版本，我们确定生产网络的内生演化可能是实现持续经济增长的强大力量。这一结果的根源在于，一些新产品的到来大大扩展了所有现有行业的技术可能性，也就是说，如果有n种产品，那么又有一个新产品的到来将增加每个现有产品可以使用的输入组合从2n-1到2n，因此可以通过选择输入组合显着降低成本。这些降低的成本随后通过较低的投入价格传播到其他行业，并激励他们也采用其他投入。

We develop a framework consisting of a neoclassical trade model with labor mobility in which locations are arranged on a graph. Goods must be shipped through linked locations, and transport costs depend on congestion and on the infrastructure in each link, giving rise to an optimal transport problem in general equilibrium. The optimal transport network is the solution to a social planner's problem of building infrastructure in each link. We provide conditions such that this problem is globally convex, guaranteeing its numerical tractability. We also study cases with increasing returns to transport technologies in which global convexity fails. We apply the framework to assess optimal investments and inefficiencies in the road networks of European countries.",我们研究空间平衡中的最佳运输网络。我们开发了一个框架，该框架由具有劳动力流动性的新古典主义贸易模型组成，该模型中的位置在图表上排列。货物必须通过链接的位置进行运输，运输成本取决于交通拥堵和每个链接中的基础设施，从而在总体平衡中产生了最佳运输问题。最佳的运输网络是社会规划者在每个链接中建立基础设施问题的解决方案。我们提供了使该问题在全局上凸的条件，从而保证了其数值可处理性。我们还研究了全球凸性失效的运输技术回报增加的案例。我们应用该框架来评估欧洲国家道路网络中的最佳投资和低效率。

Network formation models present difficulties for identification, especially when links can be interdependent, for example, when indirect connections matter. We show how one can use the observed proportions of various local network structures to learn about the underlying preference parameters. The key assumption for our approach restricts individuals to have bounded degree in equilibrium, implying a finite number of payoffâ€�relevant local structures. Our main result provides necessary conditions for parameters to belong to the identified set. We then develop a quadratic programming algorithm that can be used to construct this set. With further restrictions on preferences, we show that our conditions are also sufficient for pairwise stability and therefore characterize the identified set precisely. Overall, the use of both the economic model along with pairwise stability allows us to obtain effective dimension reduction.",本文提供了一个框架，用于在链路成对稳定的大型网络中识别首选项。网络形成模型给识别带来了困难，特别是当链接可以相互依赖时，例如，当间接连接很重要时。我们展示了如何使用观察到的各种本地网络结构比例来了解潜在的偏好参数。我们方法的关键假设限制了个体在均衡中具有有限的程度，这意味着收益的有限数量-相关的局部结构。我们的主要结果为参数属于确定的集合提供了必要条件。然后，我们开发可用于构造此集合的二次规划算法。通过对首选项的进一步限制，我们证明了我们的条件也足以实现成对稳定性，因此可以精确地表征已识别的集合。总体而言，同时使用经济模型和成对稳定性可使我们获得有效的尺寸缩减。

This behavior has traditionally been modeled via unit roots or fractional Brownian motion and explained via aggregation of heterogeneous processes, nonlinearity, learning dynamics, regime switching, or structural breaks. This paper identifies a different and complementary mechanism for long‐memory generation by showing that it can naturally arise when a large number of simple linear homogeneous economic subsystems with short memory are interconnected to form a network such that the outputs of the subsystems are fed into the inputs of others. This networking picture yields a type of aggregation that is not merely additive, resulting in a collective behavior that is richer than that of individual subsystems. Interestingly, the long‐memory behavior is found to be almost entirely determined by the geometry of the network, while being relatively insensitive to the specific behavior of individual agents.",许多时间序列都表现出“长时间记忆”：它们的自相关函数随延迟而缓慢衰减。传统上，这种行为是通过单位根或分数布朗运动建模的，并通过异质过程，非线性，学习动力学，状态切换或结构破坏的聚集来解释。本文通过说明当大量具有短记忆的简单线性同质经济子系统相互连接形成一个网络，从而将子系统的输出馈入网络时，便会自然产生一种不同的互补机制。其他人的投入。该网络图产生的聚合类型不仅是累加的，而且导致的集体行为比单个子系统的集体行为更丰富。有趣的是，发现长内存行为几乎完全由网络的几何形状决定，而对单个代理的特定行为相对不敏感。

We develop a reputational framework to explore how a monitor's effectiveness depends on her network position. Savers who care about whether others perceive them as responsible should save more with central monitors, who more widely disseminate information, and proximate monitors, who pass information to individuals with whom the saver interacts frequently. We randomly assign monitors to savers and find that monitors on average increase savings by 36%. Consistent with the framework, more central and proximate monitors lead to larger increases in savings. Moreover, information flows through the network, with 63% of monitors telling others about the saver's progress. Fifteen months after the conclusion of the experiment, other villagers have updated their beliefs about the saver's responsibility in response to the intervention.",我们进行了一项实验，研究与其他村民（“监测员”）分享有关实现自己设定的储蓄目标的进度的信息时，个人是否储蓄更多。我们开发了一个声誉框架，以探索监控人员的效率如何取决于其网络位置。关心他人是否认为自己有责任感的储户应该通过中央监控员（他们更广泛地传播信息）和邻近的监控员（他们将信息传递给经常与之进行交互的个人）来节省更多。我们将监控器随机分配给储户，发现监控器平均可节省36％。与该框架一致，更多的中央和近距离监控器可以导致更大的储蓄增长。此外，信息流经网络，其中63％的监视器告诉其他人有关保护程序进度的信息。实验结束十五个月后，其他村民已经更新了他们对储户责任的信念，以响应干预措施。

Agents initially guess the binary state of the world after observing a private signal. In subsequent rounds, agents observe their network neighbors' previous guesses before guessing again. Agents are drawn from a mixture of learning types—Bayesian, who face incomplete information about others' types, and DeGroot, who average their neighbors' previous period guesses and follow the majority. We study (1) learning features of both types of agents in our incomplete information model; (2) what network structures lead to failures of asymptotic learning; (3) whether realistic networks exhibit such structures. We conducted lab experiments with 665 subjects in Indian villages and 350 students from ITAM in Mexico.

We establish existence, uniqueness of equilibrium consumption, and generic uniqueness of equilibrium transfers. We characterize the geometry of the network of transfers and highlight the key role played by transfer intermediaries. We then study comparative statics.

Much of the literature focuses on the speed of diffusion as a function of the network topology.

Specifically, actions are either strategic substitutes or strategic complements, and participants have either complete or incomplete information about the structure of a random network. Since economic environments typically have a considerable degree of complementarity or substitutability, this framework applies to a wide variety of settings. We examine behavior and equilibrium selection. The degree of equilibrium play is striking, in particular with incomplete information. Behavior closely resembles the theoretical equilibrium whenever this is unique; when there are multiple equilibria, general features of networks, such as connectivity, clustering, and the degree of the players, help to predict informed behavior in the lab. People appear to be strongly attracted to maximizing aggregate payoffs (social efficiency), but there are forces that moderate this attraction: (1) people seem content with (in the aggregate) capturing only the lion's share of the efficient profits in exchange for reduced exposure to loss, and (2) uncertainty about the network structure makes it considerably more difficult to coordinate on a demanding, but efficient, equilibrium that is typically implemented with complete information.",在本文中，我们描述了一系列实验室实验，这些实验实现了一般网络结构的特定示例。具体而言，行动是战略替代或战略补充，参与者具有关于随机网络结构的完整或不完整信息。由于经济环境通常具有相当程度的互补性或可替代性，因此该框架适用于多种环境。我们研究行为和均衡选择。均衡游戏的程度令人震惊，特别是在信息不完整的情况下。只要这是独特的，行为就非常类似于理论平衡。当存在多个均衡时，网络的一般功能（例如连接性，群集和参与者的程度）有助于预测实验室中的明智行为。人们似乎强烈地希望最大程度地提高总收益（社会效率），但是有一定的力量可以缓和这种吸引力：（1）人们似乎满足于（总的）仅捕获有效利润中的最大份额，以换取减少的风险（2）网络结构的不确定性使协调要求苛刻但有效的平衡变得更加困难，而平衡通常是通过完整的信息实现的。

If carriers do not compete aggressively, an equilibrium with competing hub‐spoke networks exists as long as the number of cities is not too small.
